This is the repository of *Module 7- Testing the viability of carbon capture with AI* of the **CEAD 2024 | Reduction of carbon footprint in industry and beyond**.<br>
This repository contains the exercise data, assignment and auxiliary functions created for this course. Two exercises are available; they have the same aim but cover different cases: the first refers to the high gas flow rate case, and the second to the low gas flow rate case. At the end of the course, an extensive solution to the exercise will be updated as well.<p>

## File description
* `Assignment_Group1.pdf`: The assignment to be completed by the 1<sup>st</sup> group.
* `experimental_dataset_1.csv`: The data for the model training in assignment 1.
* `Assignment_Group2.pdf`: The assignment to be completed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> group.
* `experimental_dataset_2.csv`: The data for the model training in assignment 2.
* `utils.py`: Python file containing all the auxiliary functions used during the exercise.
